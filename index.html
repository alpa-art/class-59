        <p>I like making paintings with water colours as also oil colours. Paintings made with oil colours take time to make and get ready as the oils are slow in drying up. There is however a certain richness of colour in an oil painting. Water colours are quick to dry. I find the effect of water colours very soothing.

            Abstracts are my favourite themes for painting. But there is meaning in the abstracts I make. They are not just a splash of colour. The abstracts I make are meaningful. I love to share the representations of my abstracts with those who ask to know it. When the meanings of abstracts are seen the paintings can be appreciated. Often the meanings of abstracts are not easy to decipher. But the coming together of colour and form in a painting is in itself beautiful.

            I also like making portraits. I like to sit before a person and make their portrait. But this may not be possible always. I sketch portraits in black pen or in pencil. Portraits are interesting to make. I have made portraits of some celebrities and have had the opportunity to go and meet with them and have the portraits autographed by them. On a couple of occasions celebrities have wanted to have the picture with my signature. Such occasions humbled me.
